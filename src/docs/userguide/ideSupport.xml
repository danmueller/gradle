        <title>IntelliJ</title>
        <para>Gradle has been mainly developed with Idea IntelliJ and its very good Groovy plugin. Gradle's build script
            <footnote>
                <para>Gradle is built with Gradle
                </para>
            </footnote>
            has also been developed with the support of this IDE. IntelliJ allows you to define any filepattern to be
            interpreted as a Groovy script. In the case of Gradle you can define such a pattern for
            <filename>build.gradle</filename>
            and <filename>settings.gradle</filename>. This will already help very much. What is missing is the classpath
            to the Gradle binaries to offer content assistance for the Gradle classes. You might add the Gradle jar
            (which you can find in your distribution) to your project's classpath. It does not really belong there, but
            if you do this you have a fantastic IDE support for developing Gradle scripts. Of course if you use
            additional libraries for your build scripts they would further pollute your project classpath.
        </para>
        <para>We hope that in the future <filename>*.gradle</filename> files
            get special treatment by IntelliJ and you will be able to define a specific classpath for them.
        </para>

        <title>Eclipse</title>
        <para>There is a Groovy plugin for eclipse. We don't know in what state it is and how it would support Gradle.
            In the next edition of this user guide we can hopefully write more about this.

        <title>Using Gradle without IDE support</title>
        <para>What we can do for you is to spare you typing things like
            <literal>throw new org.gradle.api.tasks.StopExecutionException()</literal>
            and just type
            <literal>throw new StopExecutionException()</literal>
            instead. We do this by automatically adding a set of import statements to the Gradle scripts before Gradle
            executes them. This set is defined by a properties file
            <literal>gradle-imports</literal>
            in the Gradle distribution. It has the following content.
        </para>
        <figure>
            <title>gradle-imports</title>
            <programlisting><xi:include href='../../toplevel/gradle-imports' parse='text'/></programlisting>
        </figure>
        <para>You can define a project specific set of imports to be added to your build scripts. Just place a file
            called
            <literal>gradle-imports</literal>
            in your root project directory. If you start Gradle with the {-I} option, the imports defined in the Gradle
            distribution are disabled. The imports defined in your project directory are always used.

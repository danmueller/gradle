    <title>The Project Reports Plugin</title>

    <note>
        <para>The Project Reports Plugin is currently a work in progress, and at this stage doesn't do particularly
            much. We plan to add much more to these reports in the next release of Gradle.
        </para>
    </note>

    <para>The Project Reports Plugin adds some tasks to your project which generate reports containing useful
        information about your build.

        <title>Groovy Script Variables</title>
        <para>For Gradle users it is important to understand how Groovy deals with script variables. Groovy has two types
            of script variables. One with a local scope and one with a script wide scope.
        </para>
        <sample id="scope" dir="userguide/tutorial">
            <sourcefile file="scope.groovy"/>
            <output args=""/>
        </sample>
        <para>Variables which are declared with a type modifier are visible within closures but not visible within
            methods. This is a heavily discussed behavior in the Groovy community.
            <footnote>
                <para>One of those discussions can be found here:

        <title>Configuration and Execution Phase</title>
        <para>It is important to keep in mind that Gradle has a distinct configuration and execution phase (see 
            <xref linkend='build_lifecycle'/>).
        </para>
        <sample id="mkdirTrap" dir="userguide/tutorial/mkdirTrap">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="-q compile"/>
        </sample>
        <para>As the creation of the directory happens during the configuration phase, the
            <literal>clean</literal>
            task removes the directory during the execution phase.

    <title>Using the Gradle Command-Line</title>
    <para>This chapter introduces the basics of the Gradle command-line. You execute Gradle builds using the
        <command>gradle</command> command. You have already seen this in action in previous chapters.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Executing multiple tasks</title>
        <para>You can execute multiple tasks in a single build by listing each of the tasks on the command-line. For example,
            the command <userinput>gradle compile test</userinput> will execute the <literal>compile</literal> and
            <literal>test</literal> tasks. Gradle will execute the tasks in the order that they are listed on the
            command-line, and will also execute the dependencies for each task. Each task is executed once only,
            regardless of why it is included in the build: whether it was specified on the command-line, or it a
            dependency of another task, or both. Let's look at an example:</para>
        <sample id="multipleTasksFromCommandLine" dir="userguide/tutorial/multipleTasksFromCommandLine">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
        </sample>
        <para>Below is the result of executing <userinput>gradle -q libs test</userinput> for this build script. Notice that
            the <literal>compile</literal> task is executed once, even though it is a dependency of both
            <literal>libs</literal> and <literal>test</literal>.</para>
        <sample id="multipleTasksFromCommandLine" dir="userguide/tutorial/multipleTasksFromCommandLine">
            <output args="-q libs test"/>
        </sample>
        <para>Because each task is executed once only, executing <userinput>gradle libs libs</userinput> is exactly the same
        as executing <userinput>gradle libs</userinput>.</para>
